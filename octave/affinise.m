%%      Reduce the dimension of a vector.
%%
%%      PARAMETERS
%%          X
%%              The vector to reduce the dimension of.  In case it is not a
%%              vector but a matrix, NaN will be returned.
%%
%%              In case that no value for X is passed to the function, NaN is
%%              assumed.
%%
%%      RETURN
%%          V
%%              The vector with the reduced dimension.
%%
%%              In case that no parameter or more than one is given, NaN will be
%%              returned.
